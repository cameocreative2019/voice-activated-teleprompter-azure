# Voice Activated Prompter

## Bootstrapping

This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/), and [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library) to create a modern [React](https://react.dev/) app compatible with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/). To generate the scaffolding, I used the following command, which is (at the time of this writing) one of the official ways of bootstrapping a React/Redux app:

```sh
npx degit reduxjs/redux-templates/packages/vite-template-redux voice-activated-prompter
```

## Scripts

- `dev`/`start` - start dev server and open browser
- `build` - build for production
- `preview` - locally preview production build
- `test` - launch test runner
